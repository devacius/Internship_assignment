# CRUD Application
I have completed the internship assignment mentioned at [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GNkmT55SDy7ppnrgTIBD2NNDKIfim4gtLpKhrGShe5M/edit) . The project has two folder:-
.frontend
.backend
## Installation
1) download the repository or clone using git clone .
2) setup your own mongodb compass for the database to work.(url mentioned is of localhost)
3) use node index.js in after moving terminal to backend folder using-
 

    cd backend 
     node index.js
4)move back to frontend folder and use npm run dev

    cd ..
    cd frontend
    npn run dev
## keypoints
1) update button will not work as the method for unique identificaiton was not informed.
2) delete button will not work as method of unique identificaion was not informed.
3) use of checkbox for sending the data to email was not properly mentioned and it is not possible(as it will use an aws machine).
4) React has been used in place of next.js for frontend development.
